# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
The project primarily utilizes the following technologies:
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language used for client-side scripting (e.g., `app.js`, `projects.js`).
- **HTML**: The markup language used for structuring the web pages (e.g., `index.html`, `projects.html`).
- **CSS/SCSS**: Stylesheets are written using SCSS, a preprocessor for CSS, which allows for more advanced styling features (e.g., files in `/styling/`).
  
There are no specific frameworks mentioned, but the use of SCSS indicates a structured approach to styling.

## Purpose of the Project
The project appears to be a web application or website that includes multiple pages, with a focus on styling and layout. It likely serves to showcase various components and sections, such as projects, skills, and contact information, as indicated by the presence of related SCSS files.
